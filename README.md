# CryptoToken_Lobo

This is a basic token developed. It has all the basic feature of Mint, Burn, Transfer, Approval, Pause, BlackListing, Increasing/ Decreasing allowance and preventing Overflow.

We have also deployed it on a test Ethereum and test Binance network and it works perfectly fine.

It also works with Liquidity pools. We have tested it with PancakeSwap and works great. We have also tested it with test Exchange like environment, Swaping works fine also.

This was for a client who does not wants to be named and his token name is different.

We are in the process of creating another Token which will have Tokenomics and other features included.
